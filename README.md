## Layout

The clock consists of 3 subcontainer: a clock filling the left side, a weather display in the upper right side and a monthly calendar right below. Even though there are two containers on the right side, I think a still managed to achieve a well-balanced layout.

## Design Thoughts
It combines the aesthetic of a minimalist version of the famous Mondaine swiss watch face and the trending use of Neumorphism.

The design tries to be functional. Every element that is shown has a purpose to be there. By the usage of whitespace and letting every subcontainer breathe, the lock creates a balanced and calming lock, while being full of information.

The clock also comes with a set of icons that try to match the minimalist and simple nature of the clock.

## Epilogue

Looking back, I feel like most people lose themselves in exotic and extravagant designs and forget about the purpose of a clock.
It shouldn't be visually loud. It's never the main attraction of a room. It has to walk the fine line between being visually pleasing or pleasing to look at and being an object of the background. It should also be in a form that allows for environmental insertion. The clock never determines the look of a room, but it does complete the look.

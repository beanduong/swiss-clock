swiss-clock is a clock, calendar and weather display written with Flutter. It is an entry for the [Flutter Clock challenge](https://flutter.dev/clock).

It combines the aesthetic of a minimalist version of the famous Mondaine swiss watch face and the trending use of Neumorphism.

The design tries to be functional. Every element that is shown has a reason to be there. By the usage of whitespace and letting every subcontainer breathe, the lock creates a balanced and calming lock, while being full of information.

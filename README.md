swiss-clock is a clock, calendar and weather display written with Flutter. It is an entry for the [Flutter Clock challenge](https://flutter.dev/clock).

The clock consists of 3 subcontainer: a clock filling the left side, a weather display in the upper right side and a monthly calendar right below. Even though there are two containers on the right side, I think a still managed to achieve a well-balanced layout.

It combines the aesthetic of a minimalist version of the famous Mondaine swiss watch face and the trending use of Neumorphism.

The design tries to be functional. Every element that is shown has a purpose to be there. By the usage of whitespace and letting every subcontainer breathe, the lock creates a balanced and calming lock, while being full of information.

The clock also comes with a set of icons that try to match the minimalist and simple nature of the clock.
